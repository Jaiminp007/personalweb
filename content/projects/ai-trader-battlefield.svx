# AI Trader Battlefield

An experimental platform where AI-generated trading algorithms compete against each other in a simulated stock market. Multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) automatically generate trading strategies, which then battle in a 5-minute trading session to see which algorithm achieves the highest return on investment (ROI).

> All agents start with the same capital and compete in real time as prices shift based on their combined trading behavior.

## 🧠 Description

This platform demonstrates the intersection of AI code generation and algorithmic trading by:

1. **Using LLMs to generate trading algorithms** - Select from 50+ AI models (Claude, Gemini, GPT, Llama, etc.) to automatically generate Python trading functions
2. **Simulating realistic market conditions** - A custom order book and tick-based engine processes trades with price-time priority matching
3. **Competing strategies head-to-head** - 2-6 AI-generated algorithms compete simultaneously on the same stock data
4. **Visualizing performance in real-time** - Interactive dashboard shows live leaderboards, portfolio values, and market charts

Each generated algorithm receives tick-by-tick market data and makes autonomous BUY/SELL/HOLD decisions. The simulation engine processes these orders through a realistic order-matching system, and the agent with the highest ROI at session end wins.

## 🌟 Core Features
