# YouTube Video Creation Automation with Heygen and OpenAI

This project automates the creation of YouTube videos using a combination of OpenAI, Heygen, n8n, and other tools to generate engaging content and upload it to YouTube.

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

1. **Download YouTube Video**: The process begins by downloading an existing YouTube video through n8n.
2. **Transcription**: The downloaded video is transcribed to extract the audio and convert it into text using AI transcription tools.
3. **AI Text Segmentation**: The transcription is processed by an AI agent, which divides the content into smaller, more digestible segments. These segments are stored in a **Google Sheet**, along with relevant metadata for each section.
4. **Image Generation**: Based on the segmented text, relevant image prompts are created and sent to an image generation API. These images are intended to match the theme of the video and will be used later in the video production process.
5. **Video Creation with Heygen**: The AI-generated images, combined with an AI avatar from Heygen, are used to produce a new video. The avatar narrates the segments, while the images appear as visual support.
6. **Subway Surfer Effect**: A Subway Surfer effect is applied at the bottom of the video, making it suitable for a "brain root" style reel.
7. **Video Upload to YouTube**: The final video is uploaded to YouTube, completing the process.
8. **Confirmation Email**: After the video is uploaded, a confirmation email is sent to notify you of the successful upload.
