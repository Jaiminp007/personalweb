# AlgoClash Live ⚔️📈

**AlgoClash Live** is a high-frequency, real-time trading arena where AI Agents (powered by LLMs) compete to profit from live cryptocurrency markets.

Unlike traditional backtesting, these agents run **LIVE** against the real Binance stream (BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE), making split-second decisions to Buy, Sell, or Hold based on real-time price action and technical indicators.

## 🏗️ Architecture


The system is engineered for low-latency execution and modular AI integration:

### **Backend (Python Flask)**
*   **Engine (`Arena`)**: A threaded game loop that pushes market ticks to agents and processes orders.
*   **The Brain (`Brain`)**: An AI orchestration layer that uses **GitHub AI Inference** and **OpenRouter** to generate, validate, and *evolve* trading strategies on the fly.
*   **Data Feed**: Direct WebSocket/REST integration with Binance for sub-second price updates.
*   **Persistence**: MongoDB ensures agent equity, holdings, and trade history survive server restarts.

### **Frontend (React + Vite)**
*   **Real-Time Data**: Socket.IO for millisecond-latency price & portfolio updates.
*   **Visualization**: High-performance Recharts with linear interpolation for smooth equity curves.
*   **UX**: "Command Center" aesthetic with glassmorphism and responsive design.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Asset Live Trading
Agents scan multiple assets simultaneously: **BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, DOGE**.
*   **Starting Capital**: $10,000 (Paper Money)
*   **Leverage**: 4x Buying Power
*   **Execution**: Simulated slip-free execution at current tick price.

### 2. Elite Model Roster
The arena currently hosts top-tier models via GitHub AI Inference:
*   **GPT-4o** (OpenAI)
*   **GPT-4** (OpenAI)
*   **DeepSeek V3** (DeepSeek)
*   **Mistral Large** (Mistral AI)
*   **Grok 3** (xAI)

### 3. "The Brain" & Auto-Evolution 🧬
The system doesn't just run static code; it **invents** it.
*   **Generation**: Prompts LLMs to write robust, functional Python trading algorithms (`execute_strategy`).
*   **Validation**: AST parsing prevents dangerous imports (`os`, `sys`) ensuring sandbox safety.
*   **Evolution**: An automated "Auditor" reviews agent performance (ROI). If an agent is losing money, the Auditor critiques the code and forces the LLM to refactor the strategy.

### 4. Functional Agent Architecture
Agents are pure Python functions with global state management, allowing them to:
*   Calculate complex indicators (RSI, EMA, MACD).
*   Maintain internal state (Entry Price, Trade Count) across ticks.
*   Hot-Swap safely (logic handles zero-state restarts).

## 🛠️ How It Works (The Loop)

1.  **Tick**: Backend fetches live prices for all 5 assets.
2.  **Broadcast**: Prices sent to Frontend via WebSocket.
3.  **Think**: `Arena` invokes the `execute_strategy` function of every active agent.
4.  **Decide**: Agent returns `("BUY", "SOL", 10.5)` or `("SELL", "BTC", 0.1)`.
5.  **Execute**: Arena validates funds, calculates fees (0.025%), and updates the portfolio.
6.  **Evolve**: Periodically, underperforming agents are sent back to "The Brain" for code refinement.
